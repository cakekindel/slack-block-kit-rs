# slack-blocks

This crate brings Slack's terrific [Block Kit ðŸ”—] to
the Rust ecosystem.

Inside, you'll find models for all of Slack's Layout Blocks,
Block Elements, and Composition Objects. Each structure has Slack's API
documentation copied in-place so you don't have to leave your editor to
remember the details of the block kit API.

Every model has builders that leverage Rust's type system
to help you provide every required field, so you can be confident in your app.

### Troubleshooting common compiler errors
`Method build not found for ...Builder` - Dig into the error message,
you'll find something like `RequiredMethodNotCalled<method::foo>`,
meaning you need to call `.foo()` before you can call `.build()`!

## Example
Using an example from Slack's Documentation:
```json
{
  "type": "section",
  "text": {
    "text": "*Sally* has requested you set the deadline for the Nano launch project",
    "type": "mrkdwn"
  },
  "accessory": {
    "type": "datepicker",
    "action_id": "datepicker123",
    "initial_date": "1990-04-28",
    "placeholder": {
      "type": "plain_text",
      "text": "Select a date"
    }
  }
}
```

You can use raw Builders like so:
```rust
use slack_blocks::{text::ToSlackMarkdown, blocks::Section, elems::DatePicker};

let section = Section::builder()
                      .text("*Sally* has requested you set the deadline for the Nano launch project".markdown())
                      .accessory(DatePicker::builder()
                                            .action_id("datepicker123")
                                            .initial_date((28, 4, 1990))
                                            .placeholder("Select a date")
                                            .build()
                      )
                      .build();
```

Or enable the `unstable` feature and use xml macros:
```rust
use slack_blocks::blox::*;

let pick_date = blox! {
  <date_picker action_id="datepicker123"
               placeholder="Select a date"
               initial_date=(28, 4, 1990) />
};

let section = blox! {
  <section_block accessory=pick_date>
    <text kind=plain>"*Sally* has requested you set the deadline for the Nano launch project"</text>
  </section_block>
};
```

Then you can send the block to Slack's API, for example:

```rust
let blocks: Vec<Block> = vec![section.into()]; // using section from examples above

let req = reqwest::Client::new()
                .post("https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage")
                .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
                .bearer_auth("<api token here>")
                .body(serde_json::json!({
                  "channel": "<a channel id>",
                  "blocks": blocks
                }).to_string())
                .build()
                .unwrap();
```

There is also a crate example (`./examples/reqwest.rs`) that can be run like so:
```sh
> export SLACK_API_TOKEN=foo
> export SLACK_API_TOKEN=bar
> cargo run --all-features --example reqwest
```
