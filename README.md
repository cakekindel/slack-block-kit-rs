# slack-blocks

[docs ðŸ”—]

This crate brings Slack's terrific [Block Kit ðŸ”—] to
the Rust ecosystem.

This crate should hopefully come in handy if you need to
build some rich functionality, or just want to send some
slack messages without having to know Block Kit.

Inside, you'll find simple models with an API that is
thoroughly documented and (hopefully) easy to use.

This is currently being actively developed so watch the repo for a
stable v1 release!
