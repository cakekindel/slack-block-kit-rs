//! This crate brings Slack's terrific [Block Kit ðŸ”—] to
//! the Rust ecosystem.
//!
//! This crate should hopefully come in handy if you need to
//! build some rich functionality, or just want to send some
//! slack messages without having to know Block Kit.
//!
//! Inside, you'll find simple models with an API that is
//! thoroughly documented and (hopefully) easy to use.
//!
//! This is currently being actively developed so watch the repo for a
//! stable v1 release!
//!
//! [Block Kit ðŸ”—]: https://api.slack.com/block-kit
//!
//! # Build / Test / Format
//! This crate uses [`cargo-make`] for script consistency, in Makefile.toml you'll find:
//!   - `cargo make fmt`: Format all files according to configured style `rustfmt.toml`
//!   - `cargo make test`: Run all tests
//!   - `cargo make doctest`: Run doc tests only
//!   - `cargo make tdd`: Watch files for changes, and run `cargo make test` on each change
//!   - `cargo make ci`: Run tests, check that code is formatted and no lint violations.
//!                      This is run as a quality gate for all pull requests.
//!
//! # Contributing
//!
//! If you're interested in contributing, head over to the [issues] and see what's left to
//! do to get this crate fully usable and stable - at the time of writing there are a few
//! big-picture things left to do:
//!
//! - Implement Block Elements ([#61](https://github.com/cakekindel/slack-blocks-rs/issues/61))
//! - ~~Implement Composition Objects ([#63](https://github.com/cakekindel/slack-blocks-rs/issues/63))~~
//! - Remove the `validator` crate from the public API ([#9](https://github.com/cakekindel/slack-blocks-rs/issues/9))
//! - Add a `validation` crate feature ([#8](https://github.com/cakekindel/slack-blocks-rs/issues/8))
//!
//! And this doesn't block a v1.0.0, but is definitely something I'm interested in doing for this crate,
//! that will make it a lot nicer to interact with:
//! - Add a proc-macro of some kind that allows easy creation of block messages (#??)
//!
//! This repo follows [Conventional Commits] in order to fully automate the semver process,
//! but you don't _need_ to follow this convention since the repo is configured for Squash
//! commits on merge.
