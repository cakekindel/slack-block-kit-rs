//! This crate brings Slack's terrific [Block Kit ðŸ”—] to
//! the Rust ecosystem.
//!
//! This crate should hopefully come in handy if you need to
//! build some rich functionality, or just want to send some
//! slack messages without having to know Block Kit.
//!
//! Inside, you'll find simple models with an API that is
//! thoroughly documented and (hopefully) easy to use.
//!
//! This is currently being actively developed so watch the repo for a
//! stable v1 release!
//!
