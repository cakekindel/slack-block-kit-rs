///
/// A select menu, just as with a standard HTML `<select>` tag,
/// creates a drop down menu with a list of options for a user to choose.
///
/// The select menu also includes type-ahead functionality, where a user can type
/// a part or all of an option string to filter the list.
///
/// To use interactive components, you will need to make some changes to prepare your app.
/// Read our [guide to enabling interactivity ðŸ”—].
